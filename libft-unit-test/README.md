==========[THE TESTS]==========

This project use dynamic libraries to get all function the test needs to run.

This allows tow interesting things, the first is in the case of you haven't finished your libft the test get only the finished functions so you can run this test without comment/uncomment/recompile the checker; and the second is we can add as many bonuses as we want so the most recurent bonuses in libft can be added without overload this checker !
